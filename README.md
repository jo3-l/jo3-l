# About me

Hey there! I'm Joe L., an incoming CS undergrad @ UWaterloo. 

If you're reading this introduction, you likely know me in real life (in which case, hello!) or from
the [YAGPDB project](https://yagpdb.xyz), where I am an administrator and [open-source
contributor](https://github.com/botlabs-gg/yagpdb/commits?author=jo3-l).

Nowadays, I primarily work with Rust and Go on backend projects, but I also have experience in
Python, TypeScript, Java, and C++, among other technologies.

## Active projects

My main interest these days lies in static analysis, and, more broadly, the implementation of
programming languages and supporting tooling. I am currently working on a [language server for YAGPDB
templates](https://github.com/jo3-l/yag-template-lsp), which implements a
handwritten, error-tolerant parser using a CST and [rowan](https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rowan);
scope resolution; and a dynamic type checker.

My previous work in this space includes [implementing multiple language
features](https://github.com/botlabs-gg/template/commits/master/?author=jo3-l) in YAGPDB's
production templating engine and [building an interpreter](https://github.com/jo3-l/liftoff) for my own
toy language, Rocket.

## Other projects

- [**obscenity**](https://github.com/jo3-l/obscenity): A robust profanity detection library for
  Node.js, written in TypeScript. It implements a extensible transformer-based design and is
  thoroughly unit-tested. Used by [hundreds of open-source
  projects](https://github.com/jo3-l/obscenity/network/dependents) with [20k+ weekly downloads on
  npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/obscenity) and 500k+ downloads total.
- [**vsHacks**](https://vshacks.tech): In high school, I co-founded vsHacksâ€”a now-annual hackathon
  organized by my programming club in collaboration with other schools across the Greater Vancouver.
  I contributed extensively to [the hackathon
  website](https://github.com/vsHacks/vshacks.github.io) and helped run workshops during the event.
- [**markpdf**](https://github.com/jo3-l/markpdf): A command-line utility to efficiently edit PDF
  bookmarks using a familiar indentation-based format, built in Go.
- [**yagpdb-cc**](https://github.com/yagpdb-cc/yagpdb-cc): The largest community collection of
  custom commands for YAGPDB, accessible through [a Docusaurus-powered
  website](https://yagpdb-cc.github.io). I created and continue to maintain this project, and have
  built various automation in Go ([yagfuncdata](https://github.com/jo3-l/yagfuncdata),
  [action-check-yag-tmpl-syntax](https://github.com/jo3-l/action-check-yag-tmpl-syntax)) to aid in
  maintenance.
- [**competitive programming**](https://github.com/jo3-l/cp-practice): Solutions to various competitive
- programming problems, written primarily in C++ and Java. See also [my account on the DMOJ](https://dmoj.ca/user/jo3_l).
