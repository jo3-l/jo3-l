# About me

Hi! I'm Joseph Liu, a first-year CS student at the University of Waterloo.

If you're reading this, you probably know me in real life (ðŸ‘€) or through my involvement with the
YAGPDB Discord bot, where I am an administrator and [longtime
contributor](https://github.com/botlabs-gg/yagpdb/commits?author=jo3-l).

## Current and past work

This summer, I'm interning at TD Bank as a software developer on the Enterprise Innovation team.

On my own time, I recently built a [language server](https://github.com/jo3-l/yag-template-lsp)
and some related static analysis tools for YAGPDB's scripting language in Rust. Some of my older
work includes

- interpreters for various [scripting](https://github.com/botlabs-gg/template/commits/master/?author=jo3-l)
  [languages](https://github.com/jo3-l/liftoff);
- a popular [profanity detection package on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/obscenity), used directly in 300+ projects;
- [PDF editing utilities](https://github.com/jo3-l/markpdf);
- [algorithmic puzzles](https://github.com/jo3-l/cp-practice);
- organizing a [local hackathon](https://vshacks.github.io/);

and, of course, contributing to [YAGPDB.xyz](https://yagpdb.xyz), a large-scale distributed Discord bot for automated content moderation
and community management.

If any of these happen to align with your interestsâ€”or if you'd just like to get in touchâ€”I'm always
happy to talk. My email is `jliu1602 [at] gmail.com`; I am also active on Discord as `jo3_l`.

An extended version of this introduction is [on my website](https://jo3-l.dev/about/).
