# About me

Hi! I'm Joseph Liu, a second-year CS student at the University of Waterloo.

## Current and past work

Most of my open-source work centers around the [YAGPDB project](https://yagpdb.xyz), a large-scale distributed Discord bot for which I am an administrator and open-source contributor. Over the years I have broken many things and fixed a couple in return ([list of highlights](https://jo3-l.dev/about/#contributions-to-yagpdb)); I am currently the [top external contributor](https://github.com/botlabs-gg/yagpdb/graphs/contributors) to YAGPDB with ~130 merged changes. Other than the main project, I have also built a [language server and VS Code extension](https://github.com/jo3-l/yag-template-lsp) for YAGPDB's custom scripting language (among various other tooling.)

Some of my other projects include

- a popular [profanity detection package for Node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/obscenity), used directly in 350+ projects and downloaded 30k+ times weekly on npm;
- interpreters for various [scripting](https://github.com/botlabs-gg/template/commits/master/?author=jo3-l)
  [languages](https://github.com/jo3-l/liftoff);
- [PDF editing utilities](https://github.com/jo3-l/markpdf);
- [algorithmic](https://github.com/jo3-l/cp-practice) [puzzles](https://github.com/jo3-l/advent);
- and organizing a [local hackathon](https://vshacks.github.io/) back when I was in high school.

As for professional experience,

- in Summer 2025, I interned at TD Bank as a software developer on the Enterprise Innovation team, where I prototyped an open banking integration using Plaid.

If anything above seems interesting, or if you'd just like to get in touch, I'm happy to talk! My email is `jliu1602 [at] gmail.com`; I am also on Discord as `jo3_l`.

I occasionally blog on [my website](https://jo3-l.dev/) and am active on the [Lobsters programming forum](https://lobste.rs/~jo3_l).
