# Hello there üëã

> A fan of clean, performant, and well-documented code.

## Current projects

- [`yagpdb-cc`](https://github.com/yagpdb-cc/yagpdb-cc): A collection of custom commands for the YAGPDB Discord Bot!
- [`cp-practice`](https://github.com/jo3-l/cp-practice): A dump of my solutions to various collections of programming problems; in particular, you can find a number of [CCC](https://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/computing.html) solutions and problems from [binarysearch.com](https://binarysearch.com) there.
- **Profanity toolkit**: A stand-alone package for detecting and handling profanity in text. Currently, the repository is private but it will be made public when it is in a state suitable for use by the public.
- **YAGPDB-related things**: I occasionally contribute to [`YAGPDB`](https://github.com/jonas747/yagpdb) and related projects; see my [fork of the main repository](https://github.com/jo3-l/yagpdb) and the [templating library](https://github.com/jo3-l/template).

_This is not meant to be an exhaustive list by any means; I've worked on a myriad of other projects (quite a few of which I've abandoned) which you can see by browsing through my repositories._

## About me

Hey there! I'm Joe L., a high school student and enthusiast programmer from Canada. I usually go by some variation of "Joe" or "jo3-l" on the Internet.

You probably know me in real life (in which case, hello there üëÄ) or from [YAGPDB](https://yagpdb.xyz), where I am a support member and documentation author. I mainly work with TypeScript, but I'm also reasonably proficient with Golang, Python, and Java. Currently, I'm focusing on improving my problem-solving skills, learning data structures and algorithms, and working on my profanity toolkit library (mentioned in my [project list](#current-projects)).

Outside of programming, I also enjoy hiking, playing tennis, doing math, and reading. If I'm not on the computer, there's a good chance that I'm doing one of those things.
