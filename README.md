## About me

Hey there! I'm Joe L., a high school student and enthusiast programmer from Canada. I usually go by "jo3-l" or some variation thereof on the web.

You probably know me from real life (in which case, hello there üëÄ) or from the [YAGPDB project](https://yagpdb.xyz), where I'm a frequent contributor and documentation author.

These days, I primarily work with Rust and Go on backend projects, but in the past, I've also dabbled in Python, TypeScript, Java, and C++, among others.

Occasionally, I blog about my thoughts on [my website](https://jo3-l.github.io); check out my latest post on [proving the sum of exponents law](https://jo3-l.github.io/posts/proving-the-sum-of-exponents-law/).

## Current projects

These days, my primary interest is in compiler theory; I am particularly interested in program optimization and type systems. My latest project is [yc](https://github.com/jo3-l/yc/), which aims to improve developer experience for those working on [YAGPDB](https://yagpdb.xyz) custom commands by providing editor support on par with mainstream languages.

## Past projects

In the past, I've worked on:

- [`vsHacks`](https://vshacks.tech): A hackathon organized by my programming club and others across the Greater Vancouver area. Notably, I contributed extensively to [the hackathon website](https://github.com/vsHacks/vshacks.github.io) and helped run workshops during the event.
- [`cp-practice`](https://github.com/jo3-l/cp-practice): Solutions to various collections of programming problems, written in C++ and Java. See also my accounts on the [DMOJ](https://dmoj.ca/user/jo3_l) and [binarysearch](https://binarysearch.com/@/jo3-l).
- [`liftoff`](https://github.com/jo3-l/liftoff): A tree-walking interpreter for a toy programming language, written in Python.
- [`obscenity`](https://github.com/jo3-l/obscenity): A robust profanity detection featuring extensive anti-bypass measures such as anti-zalgo and anti-lookalike Unicode characters for Node.js, written in TypeScript.
- [`yagpdb-cc`](https://github.com/yagpdb-cc/yagpdb-cc): An extensive collection of custom commands for the YAGPDB Discord Bot accessible via a [Docusaurus-powered website](https://yagpdb-cc.github.io).
- [`spectre`](https://github.com/jo3-l/spectre): General purpose Discord bot centered around a leveling system featuring dynamic image generation with a myriad of other commands, using [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/), and TypeScript.
