# About me

Hey there! I'm Joe L., an IB diploma student from Vancouver, Canada, and incoming CS undergrad @ UWaterloo.

If you're reading this introduction, you likely know me in real life (in which case, hello!) or from
the [YAGPDB project](https://yagpdb.xyz), where I am an administrator and [open-source
contributor](https://github.com/botlabs-gg/yagpdb/commits?author=jo3-l).

Nowadays, I primarily work with Rust and Go on backend projects, but I also have experience in
Python, TypeScript, Java, and C++, among other technologies.

## Current projects

My main interest these days lies in static analysis (and, more broadly, the implementation of
programming languages and supporting tooling.) I am currently working on a [language server for YAGPDB
templates](https://github.com/jo3-l/yag-template-lsp), which implements a
handwritten, error-resilient parser that produces a lossless CST with
[rowan](https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rowan); scope resolution; and a dynamic type checker.

In the past, I [implemented multiple language
features](https://github.com/botlabs-gg/template/commits/master/?author=jo3-l) in YAGPDB's
production templating engine and [wrote an interpreter](https://github.com/jo3-l/liftoff) for my own
toy language, Rocket.

I am also a regular contributor to the YAGPDB project in general, helping to
[refactor](https://github.com/botlabs-gg/yagpdb/pull/1646)
[legacy](https://github.com/botlabs-gg/yagpdb/pull/1649)
[code](https://github.com/botlabs-gg/yagpdb/pull/1218), implement new features and bugfixes, and
[write user documentation](https://github.com/botlabs-gg/yagpdb-docs-v2).

## Older projects

Previously, I worked on:

- [**vsHacks**](https://vshacks.tech): An annual hackathon organized by my programming club and
  others across the Greater Vancouver area â€” the first of its kind organized by Vancouver high
  school students, for Vancouver high school students. I contributed extensively to [the hackathon
  website](https://github.com/vsHacks/vshacks.github.io) and helped run workshops during the event.
- [**obscenity**](https://github.com/jo3-l/obscenity): A robust profanity detection library for
  Node.js, written in TypeScript. It implements a extensible transformer-based design and is
  thoroughly unit-tested. Used by [hundreds of open-source
  projects](https://github.com/jo3-l/obscenity/network/dependents) with [20k+ weekly downloads on
  npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/obscenity) and 500k+ downloads total.
- [**markpdf**](https://github.com/jo3-l/markpdf): A command-line utility to efficiently edit PDF
  bookmarks using a familiar indentation-based format.
- [**liftoff**](https://github.com/jo3-l/liftoff): A parser and interpreter for a toy (yet
  relatively complete) programming language, written in Python.
- [**yagpdb-cc**](https://github.com/yagpdb-cc/yagpdb-cc): The largest community collection of
  custom commands for YAGPDB, accessible through [a Docusaurus-powered
  website](https://yagpdb-cc.github.io). I created and continue to maintain this project, and have
  built various automation in Go ([yagfuncdata](https://github.com/jo3-l/yagfuncdata),
  [action-check-yag-tmpl-syntax](https://github.com/jo3-l/action-check-yag-tmpl-syntax)) to aid in
  maintenance.
- [**competitive programming**](https://github.com/jo3-l/cp-practice): Solutions to various collections of
  competitive programming problems, written in C++ and Java. See also [my account on the
  DMOJ](https://dmoj.ca/user/jo3_l).
