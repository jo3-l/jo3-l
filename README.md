# About me

Hey there! I'm Joe L., a high school student and enthusiast programmer from Canada. I usually go by jo3-l or some variation thereof on the web.

You probably know me from real life (in which case, hello there ðŸ‘€) or from the [YAGPDB project](https://yagpdb.xyz), where I'm a contributor and documentation author.

Nowadays, I primarily work with Rust and Go on backend projects, but in the past, I've also dabbled in Python, TypeScript, Java, and C++, among others.

Occasionally, I [blog on my website](https://jo3-l.github.io); check out my latest post on [the relationship between pressure and chemical equilibrium](https://jo3-l.github.io/posts/pressure-and-equilibrium/).

## Current projects

Sadly, various real-life commitments mean I no longer have as much time to code as I would like. That said, my most recent project was [markpdf](https://github.com/jo3-l/markpdf), a command-line utility to edit PDF bookmarks using an intuitive indentation-based text format, and of course I sporadically [contribute bugfixes and small features to the YAGPDB codebase](https://github.com/botlabs-gg/yagpdb/commits/master?author=jo3-l).

## Past projects

In the past, I've worked on:

- [**vsHacks**](https://vshacks.tech): A hackathon organized by my programming club and others across the Greater Vancouver area. Notably, I contributed extensively to [the hackathon website](https://github.com/vsHacks/vshacks.github.io) and helped run workshops during the event.
- [**obscenity**](https://github.com/jo3-l/obscenity): A robust profanity detection library featuring extensive anti-bypass measures such as anti-zalgo and anti-lookalike Unicode characters for Node.js, written in TypeScript.
- [**liftoff**](https://github.com/jo3-l/liftoff): A parser and interpreter for a toy programming language, written in Python.
- [**spectre**](https://github.com/jo3-l/spectre): General purpose Discord bot centered around a leveling system featuring dynamic image generation with a myriad of other commands, using [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/), and TypeScript.
- [**cp-practice**](https://github.com/jo3-l/cp-practice): Solutions to various collections of programming problems, written in C++ and Java. See also [my account on the DMOJ](https://dmoj.ca/user/jo3_l).
- [**yagpdb-cc**](https://github.com/yagpdb-cc/yagpdb-cc): An extensive collection of custom commands for YAGPDB accessible via a [Docusaurus-powered website](https://yagpdb-cc.github.io).
